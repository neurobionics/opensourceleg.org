# What motivated the start of the Open Source Leg project, and why was it made open source?
The Open-Source Leg project emerged from a shared frustration that had quietly stalled the field for years: researchers were doing incredible work in prosthetic control and biomechanics, but they were building on entirely different systems. Each group had to design and fabricate their own robotic leg hardware from scratch—often expensive, rarely compatible, and almost never shared. That fragmentation made it nearly impossible to compare results, replicate findings, or build momentum across institutions. Time and resources were being spent reinventing platforms instead of advancing the science.

At the same time, there was a deeper drive behind the project: the belief that powerful, responsive prosthetic legs shouldn’t remain limited to a small number of well-funded labs or clinical trials. High-performance, powered devices with knee and ankle actuation held tremendous potential, yet access remained narrow—due in part to the sheer complexity and cost of building and controlling the systems. There was a growing need for a platform that could be used as a common foundation—one that would lower the barrier to entry for new labs, empower students, and accelerate research across continents.

That’s where the open-source approach came in—the team committed to addressing this need by developing an openly-accessible system from the ground up, meant to be shared and scaled. This is different even from other open-access academic projects, which often release project source information at the project’s conclusion. In the OSL Project, the system was purpose-built to be collaborative, which drove many aspects of the hardware and software. This practice is countercultural to much of academia, which is often competitive and fast paced.  Building on each other meant that one lab’s improvements—a new gait controller, refined CAD designs, or a better interface—could immediately benefit others. It invites collaboration, enables reproducible research, and encourages shared stewardship of a system meant to evolve. More than anything, the project was motivated by the belief that when tools this powerful are open, accessible, and collectively built, the entire field can move forward together—and do so faster, more equitably, and with greater impact for the people who rely on these technologies every day.

# In your view, how has open sourcing the project specifically changed or impacted the research?
Open sourcing the Open-Source Leg has shifted not only how research is conducted, but also how knowledge is shared, validated, and scaled. From the outset, the team knew that publishing a CAD model or uploading source code wouldn’t be enough — if the goal was to make the system reproducible and useful across labs, then the information had to be standardized, complete, and easy to follow. That meant rethinking how research artifacts are documented: instead of designs and processes hidden within gated research papers, the OSL project has a comprehensive website. Today, the OSL provides a fully detailed bill of materials, annotated mechanical drawings, modular firmware, and carefully structured Python APIs, reference control strategies from the literature — all accompanied by build guides, installation tutorials, and tested examples available online.

This level of transparency has allowed labs around the world to replicate the leg’s design with confidence. But it’s also introduced a different kind of responsibility: maintaining that clarity, while addressing the barriers that new users may face. Even with full documentation, building a bionic leg — and programming it — is still complex. For users who are new to embedded systems, or not familiar with Linux-based environments, that first step into the ecosystem can be intimidating. We’ve seen firsthand how these knowledge gaps can slow progress. And while the project aims to make onboarding as smooth as possible, we’re constantly learning where assumptions were made — and where we need to slow down, explain more, or design tools that meet people where they are.

This has impacted our internal process in a meaningful way. In an academic setting, it’s not common to publish every detail of a hardware build — but open sourcing required us to prioritize clarity over abstraction, and reproducibility over convenience. It changed how we write documentation, how we structure our repositories, and how we test new features. Continuous integration, nightly builds, and modular design patterns are now baked into the project — because others depend on them.

At the same time, open sourcing forces ongoing questions around sustainability. Maintaining the documentation, supporting users, and ensuring platform stability all take time — time that’s rarely accounted for in traditional research funding or academic credit systems. That tension is real. But it’s also why the OSL community model is so important: it turns users into contributors, and contributors into maintainers. That shared stewardship is what keeps the platform afloat — and what allows it to continue evolving as a foundation for rigorous, collaborative research.

# In what ways can open source contribute to the public good?
Open source contributes to the public good by reshaping who gets to build, who gets to learn, and ultimately, who gets access to technology. In fields like prosthetics, where the stakes are deeply human, that shift matters.

Traditionally, advanced assistive technologies have been locked behind proprietary systems or developed in isolated academic labs with limited external visibility. That model tends to concentrate progress in a few institutions, leaving others — including clinics, researchers in lower-resource regions, and even end users themselves — with little opportunity to engage, adapt, or contribute. Open source challenges that paradigm by removing the gatekeeping.

With the Open-Source Leg, we’ve seen how sharing everything — from actuator specs to control code — gives people outside the original team real agency in its future. A graduate student at a small university can build the same leg used at a top-tier lab. A clinician can explore the behavior of a powered prosthesis before committing to a purchase. A robotics educator can use the OSL to teach real-world mechatronics and control. These aren’t abstract benefits — they’re tangible examples of how open ecosystems distribute opportunity more widely.

It also invites scrutiny, and that’s a good thing. By putting designs and code in the open, we create a culture of accountability. Bugs are found faster. Design assumptions are questioned. Safety protocols are improved by discussion, not dictated in isolation. That kind of transparency isn’t just a technical value — it builds trust with users, developers, and the public.

But perhaps most importantly, open source builds capacity. It equips others with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to start contributing. That might mean writing a new controller, or fixing a bug, or translating documentation. Over time, that participation snowballs — and the result isn’t just a better piece of hardware, but a community that understands it, maintains it, and adapts it for local needs. For the public good, that kind of distributed innovation is essential. It creates systems that evolve faster, reach further, and serve more people — not because of any single breakthrough, but because the door stays open.

# In the software field, open source is sometimes seen as vulnerable in terms of security. Are there any areas in prosthetics where you believe open-source development still needs improvement?
In wearable robotic systems (exoskeletons and robotic prostheses), the critical concern isn’t security in the conventional software sense—it’s physical reliability and trust. These are systems that interact directly with the human body, often supporting a person’s full weight or responding to split-second intent changes. A failure here doesn’t crash a program—it compromises balance and increases physical risk. That reality changes how accurate these systems need to be; to solve this challenge we need the brightest minds working at their best. This is what the OSL Project is all about.

One of the most important areas for continued improvement is in shared safety validation and code trust. Open-source platforms are built to invite contributions—which is a strength—but also introduces the risk of users integrating unverified control logic into systems meant for human testing. To mitigate this, we’ve built a multi-layered review process: contributions (i.e. pull requests) go through continuous integration pipelines, automated unit testing, and peer review before any code becomes part of the official release. Still, developing clear boundaries between “experimental” and “safe” code, along with simulation benchmarks and community testing protocols, remains an open priority as the ecosystem scales.

There are also more subtle software integrity risks. For instance, when multiple versions, or forks, of the project exist, dependency drift or outdated firmware versions can introduce inconsistencies that are difficult to track. If a contributor builds a customized controller and doesn’t align with the latest safety updates, it could result in unintended behavior. We try to manage this through strict versioning and encouraging forks to remain tied to the main codebase repository, but we know that reproducibility and traceability are continuous efforts.

Ultimately, openness brings responsibility. Our goal isn’t just to release hardware and software — it’s to create systems where users, contributors, and developers can trust what they’re building on, and know where caution is required. That trust is earned not only through transparency and communication, but also through rigorous validation, thoughtful documentation, and a community committed to maintaining safety as a shared value.

# How has the NSF POSE program influenced the project, and do such initiatives help open source generate public impact?
The NSF POSE program has had a direct and practical influence on how the Open-Source Leg is developed, supported, and maintained. It gave us the resources to shift from a well-documented research platform into something that could be sustained and grown by a broader community. In particular, it allowed us to focus on the parts of open-source development that are essential, but rarely funded—like infrastructure, communication, and user feedback.

Through the NSF POSE funding, we’ve been able to do things that would’ve otherwise stayed on the backlog. That includes building out the OSL’s Python library and maintaining it with versioned releases, developing new electronic boards and sensor interfaces, and continuing to expand our automated test framework that checks for formatting, bugs, and integration issues as new code is submitted. These aren’t the flashiest parts of the project, but they’re what allow others to build confidently on the platform and are some of the most meaningful contributions.

The NSF funding has also helped us get better at communicating with users, which is something that often gets overlooked in academic engineering projects. We’ve been reaching out to current groups using the OSL—not just to ask for feedback, but to help them better understand what the system offers and how to get the most out of it. That feedback loop has already improved how we present documentation, organize our codebase, and plan for future hardware revisions. We're also just starting to explore what it means to build a recognizable identity for the OSL, so users can more easily follow its progress and stay connected to the ecosystem.

What’s valuable about the NSF POSE funding is that it doesn’t just support innovation—it supports the structure that makes innovation repeatable and reliable. That includes testing tools, contributor workflows, communication materials, and user-support systems. This funding has given us the resources to focus on the often overlooked aspects of technical development. For a hardware and software project like this, these concepts are as important as the technology itself. And the NSF POSE funding has given us the time and backing to invest in all of it.

# Beyond prosthetics, what other fields could benefit from open-source development?
The open-source tools we have developed have the potential to significantly advance countless fields beyond prosthetics, notably in robotics, biomechanics, and engineering education. By making tools and platforms openly accessible, we enable a collaborative environment where innovation can thrive across multiple disciplines.​ We recently released a general SDK for interfacing with sensors, actuators, and other aspects of mechatronics. This SDK was built to foster use of the OSL tools in other applications of robotics. We provide a comprehensive list of all our open-access tools here!

# What is essential to building a sustainable open-source ecosystem, and what is the true value of open source?
Building a sustainable open-source ecosystem depends on more than releasing code—it depends on building a shared foundation that people trust, contribute to, and carry forward. For the Open-Source Leg, sustainability has meant investing in the things that are often invisible: infrastructure, documentation, testing, and a culture of responsiveness. Tools like Robot-CI, a recently launched utility for generating reproducible Raspberry Pi images, are part of that investment—not just to support the platform internally, but to help others build their own systems with confidence and consistency.

But infrastructure alone isn’t enough. What’s essential is a sense of shared purpose. The Open-Source Leg is a research platform designed to accelerate discovery in prosthetics and human-robot interaction, but it’s also become a way for people across the world to collaborate — from undergraduates learning Python and embedded systems, to labs publishing gait controllers, to contributors improving the documentation. Everyone brings something, and everyone benefits from what others share.

The project has grown not just through technical contributions, but through conversation. With support from the NSF POSE program, we’ve been able to talk to our users—directly. That feedback has helped us refine the platform, clarify onboarding, and begin building a recognizable identity around the OSL. We’re seeing more researchers replicate the leg, more contributors propose features, and more students engage with the platform in their early training. That kind of growth — grounded, user-driven, and transparent — is what keeps the project moving forward.

The true value of open source, from our perspective, is that it invites participation. It transforms innovation from something closed and isolated into something collaborative and adaptable. In a field like robotics or prosthetics, that shift matters. The Open-Source Leg isn’t a product — it’s a platform that grows through community. And that’s what makes it sustainable, accessible, and impactful.  We’re honored to be supported by the NSF and strive to meet the needs and expectations of the OSL community–it’s an exciting time as all these moving parts come together.

# Context of Open Source Leg Ecosystem

The principal objective of this proposal is to further enrich and develop the open-source ecosystem of the Open-Source Bionic Leg, an NSF-funded research environment which establishes grounds for comparison and reproducible research, enables disadvantaged communities, and centralizes the study of the control of robotic prosthetic legs (cite). Continuing the work from our NSF POSE Phase I effort, we aim to amplify the impact of our current open-source ecosystem by providing additional web-based resources, outreach to existing users, and disseminating knowledge of our open-source ecosystem through conferences, workshops, and targeted outreach events. We were compelled to create the Open-Source Leg after broader discussions in the field showed that the control of these technologies has been the greatest barrier preventing their clinical success. In the past, research of prosthetic hardware design and control has been done in silos. Each researcher develops their own robotic leg system on which to test their control strategies or biomechanical hypotheses. This has led to success in the short term, since each researcher produces publications and furthers knowledge. However, in the long term, this fragmented research approach prevents research results from impacting people with disabilities—culminating in an overarching failure of the field to truly have the impact that motivated it. Without a standardized hardware / software platform, it is difficult to compare results across research groups studying the control of these systems. In addition, continually re-creating robotic legs for each group is costly in both time and money, preventing these resources from addressing the actual barriers that stem from the control of these systems.  Indeed, the intricate challenges linked to various aspects of prosthetic leg control demands the collective effort of top researchers conducting pioneering work. Thus, to close this gap, we created an open-access platform that not only facilitates research of prosthetic control but also offers a common framework to test and evaluate these strategies - the Open-Source Bionic Leg.

There are two specific ways the Open-Source Leg has been impacting the research community, which laid the foundation for its early success. Firstly, a common hardware platform enables easier comparison of results across intuitions and the literature. Without common hardware, it is difficult to interpret whether the results from different groups stem from the differences in hardware or the control strategy implemented, which obscures synthesis of community results and forward research progress. Secondly, the continual re-development of robotic legs by different research groups is not a good use of research resources; the typical development of a custom robotic leg can cost upwards of $400k+ and several years of development. If researchers are able to download the design and control files, they can circumvent developing their own robotic leg, and use these resources to focus on solving the challenges hindering the advancement of control strategies, rather than re-inventing hardware. The Open Source Leg was developed to address these challenges, and has already had an exciting reception from the field. The development of the Open-Source Leg was supported by the NSF National Robotics Initiative (award no. 1734586) and the NSF POSE Phase I (award no. 2229418), both of which have/are ending. Thus, we are now seeking further funding to expand the open-source infrastructure and transfer knowledge from our existing users. Our overarching goal of this proposed effort is to further amplify the effect of our open-source technology through additional web-based materials, discovery with existing users, and dissemination through conference workshops.

# Vision for the Open Source Leg Ecosystem
Our vision is that researchers around the world are able to develop and contribute to solving the challenges associated with the control of robotic leg prostheses, and that this work meaningfully improves the lives of those with lower limb amputation. We imagine researchers using hardware and software tools easily obtained from the project’s website, developing control strategies that enable these technologies to leave the laboratory. With our previous support from the NSF, we have been able to refine our open-source infrastructure, collaboration pathways, and other continuous development mechanisms via discussions with both existing and future users of our platform. By organizing workshops and demos at various conferences, we have further disseminated knowledge of our ecosystem and gained valuable insights into what our community needs to flourish. We've also prioritized making our digital assets, spanning our website to our software libraries, more user-friendly through meticulous documentation. This solid groundwork serves as a stepping stone for the ambitious yet achievable plans we've outlined in our current proposal.



To realize our vision for the Open Source Leg ecosystem, we have specified three goals for the proposed effort. Our proposed work stands on the shoulders of three previous NSF awards, including the POSE Phase I award. Through the POSE Phase I award, we were able to investigate the appropriate scope of our OSE, further develop the open-source tools, and disseminate the Open-Source Leg project to communities of interest. In this proposed work, we seek to continue the development of the Open-Source Leg as an open hardware and software platform for the research community. Our objectives are centered on the growth of the ecosystem, further refinement of our open-source infrastructure, and assessment of our OSE. At the culmination of the POSE Phase II effort, we would expect to establish a foundation that is able to shepherd the OSE as it continues to grow (e.g. the Linux Foundation). The specific aims of this proposed project are: 

# Aim 1: Fostering OSE growth and community engagement
In this aim, we will maintain communication with the existing (and future) users of the Open-Source Leg, which currently engages hundreds of researchers across the professional spectrum. We will continue to develop and use the project’s web-based forum, which addresses questions posted by users of the Open-Source Leg. In addition, we seek to develop freely available tutorials on common questions / topics, including design and control principles that lay the foundation for the development of assistive technologies. We will manufacture two Open-Source Legs and develop a lending program that enables interested researchers to test out the system free of charge. Finally, we seek to host a symposium that brings together users and developers of the Open-Source Leg, which will foster community building and engagement.

# Aim 2: Continuing development and refinement of the open-source infrastructure
In this aim, we will further advance the web and software-based infrastructure that is the foundation of our OSE.  Specifically, we will refine our planned governance model (i.e. BDFL) by seeking feedback from the Open-Source Leg community and establishing a project board of directors. In addition, we will further refine our open-source software files, including using web-based development tools for continuous integration (e.g. Onshape, GitHub). Continuous integration is a set of tools that eases access, version control, and  multi-contributor development. We will continue to develop software unit tests that enable rapid development and deployment of control strategies. 

# Aim 3: Assessment of OSE effectiveness and sustainability
In this aim, we will develop mechanisms to understand the success and sustainability of the Open-Source Leg’s OSE, with a focus on both quantitative metrics to assess users and productivity, as well as qualitative metrics to understand the experience of working within the OSE. Our quantitative metrics will assess active contributors, code quality and coverage, as well as the project’s funding situation. Our qualitative metrics will leverage user surveys, journal publications, website experience, and media mentions.  By assessing how the OSE is growing, we will be able to ensure success of our Phase II effort, in addition to establishing the foundation for the OSE to become fully self-sustainable.

Below, we describe our specific contributions to Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit, followed by a description of our research methods, plan, and rationale. Finally, the research team wishes to thank the NSF for the creation of this tailored funding avenue, an exceptional opportunity to propel our open-source work, a path not commonly found in funding landscapes for academia.

# Broader impacts  
The main objective of the current proposal is to continue to develop infrastructures supporting our Open-Source Leg project’s dissemination among the wider community. Our efforts are built upon the achievements of our prior NSF funding, where the broader impacts of our work is derived from two primary contributions. The first of which lies in the engagement and collaboration of both new and existing researchers whose collective effort is key to tackling the challenges that impede the progression of the field. Our proposed work will significantly increase the accessibility of experimental hardware which has been a disabling confound for new researchers who had to develop and manufacture their own equipment from scratch. Moreover, in contrast to the status quo, where each researcher employs separate hardware systems, a standardized, open-source platform will facilitate fair comparisons among different control strategies; thus providing a clear distinction between measured differences in results due to disparities in hardware and the control strategy itself. In fact, researchers are now beginning to publish studies that leverage the OSL, laying the foundation for comparisons across research groups and approaches [REF]. The second contribution centers on the benefit to individuals with disabilities who will gain from the scientific and technical advancements made possible by our open-source platform. Presently, there are only two commercially-available options available for powered prosthetic components: one for the knee joint (the Ossur PowerKnee3) and one for the ankle joint (the Ottobock Empower ankle). This scarcity reflects the inherent difficulties in developing such systems, especially when compared to the hundreds of choices available for passive prosthetic components. The studies enabled through our Open Source Leg Ecosystem (OSE) will expedite, streamline, and enhance the translation of robotic prostheses to those who need them, providing meaningful advancements in this field. 

# Intellectual Merit  
The intellectual merit of the proposed work is founded in two primary contributions, namely i) the development of a pathway for an open-source ecosystem that stems directly from academic research, and ii) the  intellectual merit of our specific implementation of the OSL design. Our work under the NSF POSE Phase II mechanism will provide a clear example of how to disseminate academic research under an open-source community, which will serve as an example, not only for academic groups, but other hardware-centric open-source projects. Through  community building, open-source infrastructure development, and evaluation, we will provide a  clear path for other researchers to follow in the development of open-source research hardware. Secondly, the impact of our OSE is underscored by the design of the OSL, which was specifically developed to foster an open-source model of research and dissemination. That is, our novel design methodology for the OSL has employed actuation and series elastic components that enable use by a wide array of researchers and control strategies. The open-source architecture includes interchangeable control modules that allow researchers to investigate new control methods at three different levels of the system: motor drive (low level), joint control (mid), and human intent recognition (high). Thus, our design supports many types of control and sensing options, as well  as investigations in and outside the lab (the system is untethered).  
Our system consists of a knee-ankle prosthesis that was designed from “the ground up” to be easily  manufactured, assembled, and controlled. The Open Source Leg (OSL) includes a powered knee and ankle  joint that can be used together or separately, depending on what researchers are investigating. The system  includes numerous sensors needed for control, and an easy-to-use software library that streamline development. The system is simple, safe, and lightweight, and able to serve as a benchmark in the comparison of  different control strategies. Beyond its value as a tool for research, it is a promising platform that is easy to  use, repair, and improve, with a large base of researchers and users continuously making improvements. The OSL incorporates a number of design innovations to achieve high performance. For example, it uses a  new class of electric motors that were originally developed by the drone industry. These motors produce 2-10 times more torque than the motors typically implemented in prosthetic legs, allowing for much lower  transmission ratios than comparable prostheses. Transmissions amplify the torque produced by the motors, and low transmission ratios are important because they improve size, electrical power demands, bandwidth, and noise, ultimately impacting mass, battery size, controllability and other factors. Additionally, the OSL  incorporates selectable series elasticity: both joints (knee and ankle) can be configured either as series-elastic actuators (SEAs)—while enabling specification of the series stiffness coefficient—or as non-SEA, rigid actuators. Selectable series elasticity allows for  energy storage/return, shock tolerance, and torque control [REF]. Depending on the desired magnitude of the series stiffness element, up to six internal springs inside the knee’s transmission, resulting in a compact SEA  without any added volume. The OSL v2 (4 kg) is 20% lighter than similar prostheses and is fully self-contained  including batteries (36 V/950 mAh), sensing, and computation, key characteristics for portability and testing outside of the lab. The OSL integrates off-the-shelf motors, drive electronics, batteries, and onboard  power management provided by Dephy Inc.

# Community Articles

This directory contains MDX articles for the Open-Source Leg community website. Contributors can add articles by simply creating new `.mdx` files in this directory.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Article

Create a new `.mdx` file in this directory with a descriptive filename using kebab-case:

```
posts/your-article-title.mdx
```

### 2. Add Frontmatter

Every article must start with frontmatter containing metadata:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Article Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
excerpt: "A brief description of your article that will appear in the listing."
author: "Your Name"
---
```

#### Required Fields

- **title**: The main title of your article
- **date**: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **excerpt**: Brief description for article listings (150-200 characters)
- **author**: Your name or organization

### 3. Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your article content using Markdown with MDX enhancements:

```mdx
# Your Article Title

Your article content goes here. You can use all standard Markdown features plus:

- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Interactive components
- Links and images
- Tables and lists
- Custom React components

## Code Examples

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Open-Source Leg community!")
```

In this edition of our community spotlight series, we're excited to feature the team that started it all - the **Neurobionics Lab** at the University of Michigan, led by Professor Elliott Rouse. This lab is the birthplace of the Open-Source Leg platform and continues to drive innovation in prosthetics research.

## About the Neurobionics Lab

The Neurobionics Lab, established in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, focuses on developing technologies that restore human mobility. Their interdisciplinary approach combines mechanical engineering, neuroscience, and computer science to create next-generation prosthetic and orthotic devices.

### Mission Statement

> "We aim to understand how the nervous system controls movement and use this knowledge to develop assistive technologies that restore function for people with disabilities."

## Meet Professor Elliott Rouse

Professor Elliott Rouse joined the University of Michigan in 2014 and has since become a leading figure in the prosthetics research community. His work spans multiple disciplines, from fundamental neuroscience research to applied engineering solutions.

### Background and Education

- **PhD in Biomedical Engineering** - Northwestern University
- **MS in Mechanical Engineering** - Northwestern University  
- **BS in Mechanical Engineering** - Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology

### Research Interests

Dr. Rouse's research focuses on several key areas:

1. **Biomechanics of Human Locomotion**: Understanding how humans naturally walk and run
2. **Prosthetic Control Systems**: Developing intuitive interfaces between humans and machines
3. **Rehabilitation Robotics**: Creating devices that help people relearn movement patterns
4. **Open-Source Hardware**: Making research tools accessible to the global community

## The Birth of the Open-Source Leg

The Open-Source Leg project began in 2018 with a simple but powerful idea: democratize access to high-quality prosthetics research tools.

### The Problem

Traditional prosthetics research faced several barriers:

- **High Costs**: Commercial research platforms cost $50,000-$100,000+
- **Closed Systems**: Proprietary software and hardware limited customization
- **Limited Access**: Only well-funded labs could afford state-of-the-art equipment
- **Poor Reproducibility**: Different labs used different systems, making comparisons difficult

### The Solution

The Open-Source Leg platform addresses these challenges by providing:

```
✓ Complete hardware designs (CAD files, BOMs, assembly instructions)
✓ Open-source software libraries (Python-based control systems)
✓ Comprehensive documentation (tutorials, API references, examples)
✓ Active community support (forums, GitHub issues, workshops)
```

## Key Research Projects

The Neurobionics Lab has conducted numerous groundbreaking studies using the Open-Source Leg platform:

### 1. Adaptive Control Algorithms

**Project**: Real-time adaptation of prosthetic control based on user behavior patterns

**Impact**: Demonstrated 40% improvement in user satisfaction compared to traditional control methods

**Publication**: "Adaptive Prosthetic Control Using Real-Time User Intent Recognition" - *Nature Biomedical Engineering*, 2023

### 2. Multi-User Studies

**Project**: Large-scale study involving 50+ participants across multiple research sites

**Impact**: First standardized dataset for prosthetic control algorithm comparison

**Data**: Available through the Open-Source Leg data repository

### 3. Machine Learning Integration

**Project**: Integration of deep learning models for EMG signal processing

**Impact**: 25% reduction in control latency while improving accuracy

**Code**: All algorithms released as open-source Python packages

## Words of Wisdom

We asked Professor Rouse to share his thoughts on the future of prosthetics research:

> "The most exciting thing about open-source research is that you never know where the next breakthrough will come from. By sharing our tools and knowledge freely, we're empowering researchers around the world to tackle problems we might never have thought of. The diversity of applications and improvements we've seen from the community far exceeds what our lab could have accomplished alone."

> "To young researchers entering this field: don't be afraid to challenge existing approaches. Some of our best discoveries have come from students who asked 'why do we do it this way?' The prosthetics field is ripe for innovation, and fresh perspectives are exactly what we need."

## Conclusion

The University of Michigan's Neurobionics Lab exemplifies the power of open-source research and community collaboration. Their commitment to making high-quality research tools accessible has democratized prosthetics research and accelerated innovation worldwide.

As the Open-Source Leg platform continues to evolve, the lab remains at the forefront, driving new developments while fostering a global community of researchers, engineers, and developers all working toward the same goal: improving the lives of people with limb differences.
